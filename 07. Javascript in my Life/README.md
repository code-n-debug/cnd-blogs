I'm not familiar with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) after I graduated from college.
I remember, way back in 2011, my first job is to get the value of elements inside a list.
Back then, it was an eye-opener for me, that you can control elements in the web using only simple scripts. 
Since then, I got hooked with it.

## Newbie in JS
Little by little I learn how to use JS by coding [vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
I was criticized for not using [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), which is the defacto library for most web developers.
At that time, I'm afraid to try [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) because it is hard for me to grasp.

## Hybrid Mobile using HTML / CSS / JS
After a few months, I moved to my next job, where I have to create a mobile app. 
I don't know how to develop mobile app natively. Luckily, 
I found [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/), which has the tagline **"develop in HTML/CSS/JS, deploy in mobile"**. [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) introduced me to [JQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) that helped me develop the front-end of the application I'm working on.

> Note: PhoneGap now has ended it's service. Please refer to [this](https://blog.phonegap.com/update-for-customers-using-phonegap-and-phonegap-build-cc701c77502c) link.

## JS compiled to Native Code
I realized that [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) wasn't smooth enough in mobile, so I looked for other alternatives with that native feel to it.

That's how I found [Appcelerator](https://www.appcelerator.com/).It was the best option for me. 
It is a platform that compiles your javascript codes into a native mobile application.

I learned how to use JSON, AJAX and XML while doing mobile development. The project expands my horizon in doing development. After that, I applied as a mobile front end developer which later transitioned me to front end development using [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## JS on the Side

It was a difficult journey, but it was worth it. I got to try many things on the side, from [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/), [SenchaJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After a few more years, I am now writing backend applications using javascript.

## My Learnings

[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) helps me grow a lot as a developer. It is fun  writing APIs, backend services, queuing, deployment, testing, or web development in Javascript. It helps me to create more!

Even now my blog is full of Javascript **"how-to's"** ðŸ˜Š.

## JS Now

[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) flourished in the span of 9 years since I first start using it. Despite having limitations, it rose to popularity as 1 of the top languages to learn nowadays. 

Love it or hate it, it plays an important role in the software development world, whether you use it or not.

### **Happy 25th Birthday, Javascript!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚ðŸ¥³ 

To show my love with JS, I recreated this [Node Garden](https://nodegarden.js.org/) to emphasize how beautiful Javascript is, in action!
